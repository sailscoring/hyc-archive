# Clarifications

Known gaps and divergences between what this archive feeds Sail Scoring and
HYC's original published record — things that come down to a modelling
decision or a gap in the captured data, not a Sail Scoring bug.

Under the as-published regime (app ADR-010) nothing is recomputed, so a
*results* delta can't arise by construction. What can still go wrong — and
belongs here — is **coverage**: pages the capture never caught, admin rows
pointing nowhere, and page shapes the archive-kit can't ingest yet.

Each entry should capture: which series/season/fleet, what's missing or
differs, the most likely cause, and a pointer to the source row/page under
`sources/reshyc/`.

## Coverage gaps (2026-07)

The emit run (`pnpm emit-as-published`) reports these counts; the details are
reproducible by re-running it.

- **~212 admin rows have no `ftp_path`.** The hyc.ie admin DB lists the
  (year, event, class) result but no published page was ever linked — mostly
  older years. Nothing to ingest; left missing.
- **~32 admin `ftp_path`s are absent from the FTP capture.** The path is
  recorded but the file wasn't on the FTP site when the daily backup ran
  (pages deleted or renamed before the capture began, e.g. `tuesday_s1/squib_hcap.htm`
  in 2016 where only a `squib_hcap_1.htm` neighbour survives). Per the
  no-guessing rule, near-miss filenames are **not** substituted.
- **15 malformed admin rows.** The CSV dump is unquoted; rows whose event or
  class names contain commas can't be split unambiguously. All current cases
  are `SC TESTING` rows for the publishing test pages (`/reshyc/sc-test/`),
  which we exclude anyway.
- **33 single-race open events on the skip-list**
  ([`as-published-skips.json`](as-published-skips.json)): Lambay Races,
  Double Handed, Round the Island, Howth→Drogheda, etc. These are genuine
  Sailwave pages but publish race results only, with no series summary
  section, and the app's archive-kit Sailwave parser requires a summary.
  Needs app-side support for race-only pages; remove entries from the
  skip-list as it lands.

## Naming approximations

- **Series display names** are `"<admin event title> <year>"` (e.g. “Wave
  Regatta 2022”), taken verbatim from the admin DB backup (trimmed of stray
  whitespace). Typos in the admin DB pass through as published.
- **Start dates are approximate.** The admin DB carries no dates; every
  series gets `<year>-04-01` so the app's per-year grouping reads correctly.
  Real dates would need to be read from the result pages themselves.
